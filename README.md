# Space-cadet

Space cadet is a mobile app that connects you with several services from Nasa, including Astromony Picture of the Day, Asteroids NeoWs (near earth object web service), and the Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker. 
You'll be able to see breath-taking photos from one of the most popular websites across all federal agencies, look up asteroids based on their closet approach to Earth, or browse the entire globe for natural events as they occur.

This will be created using React Native, Expo, Springboot and MySql.
